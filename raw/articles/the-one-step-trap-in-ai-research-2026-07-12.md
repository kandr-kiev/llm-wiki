      <h1>The One-Step Trap (in AI Research)<br>
      </h1>
      <h2>Rich Sutton</h2>
      <h3>Written up for X on July 18, 2024<br>

      The one-step trap is the common mistake of thinking that all or
      most of an AI agents learned predictions can be one-step ones,
      with all longer-term predictions generated as needed by iterating
      the one-step predictions. The most important place where the trap
      arises is when the one-step predictions constitute a model of the
      world and of how it evolves over time. It is appealing to think
      that one can learn just a one-step transition model and then roll
      it out to predict all the longer-term consequences of a way of
      behaving. The one-step model is thought of as being analogous to
      physics, or to a realistic simulator.<br>
      <br>
      The appeal of this mistake is that it contains a grain of truth:
      if all one-step predictions can be made with perfect accuracy,
      then they can be used to make all longer-term prediction with
      perfect accuracy. However, if the one-step predictions are not
      perfectly accurate, then all bets are off. In practice, iterating
      one-step predictions usually produces poor results. The one-step
      errors compound and accumulate into large errors in the long-term
      predictions. In addition, computing long-term predictions from
      one-step ones is prohibitively computationally complex. In a
      stochastic world, or for a stochastic policy, the future is not a
      single trajectory, but a tree of possibilities, each of which must
      be imagined and weighted by its probability. As a result, the
      computational complexity of computing a long-term prediction from
      one-step predictions is exponential in the length of the
      prediction, and thus generally infeasible. <br>
      <br>
      The bottom line is that one-step models of the world are hopeless,
      yet extremely appealing, and are widely used in POMDPs, Bayesian
      analyses, control theory, and in compression theories of AI.<br>
      <br>
      The solution, in my opinion, is to form temporally abstract models
      of the world using options and GVFs, as in the following
